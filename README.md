# FsCheck documentation samples
This F# project provides code examples from the official [FsCheck
official documentation](https://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck/), updated
to work with FsCheck v3.  
Given that the existing documentation targets v2, this project can
assist in pinpointing the breaking changes that need to be addressed
in the documentation.
