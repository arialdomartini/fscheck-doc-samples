# FsCheck documentation samples
This F# project provides code examples from the official [FsCheck
official documentation](https://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck/), updated
to work with FsCheck v3.  
Given that the existing documentation targets v2, this project can
assist in pinpointing the breaking changes that need to be addressed
in the documentation.


## Possible enhancements

* The `Get via NuGet` menu targets directly the NuGet page. It would
  be nicer to have a doc page with some instructions.

### Properties
* `RevRevIsOriginal` needn't be public.
